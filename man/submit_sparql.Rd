\title{Submit a SPARQL Query to a Triplestore (READ)}
\usage{
submit_sparql(query, access_options, as_dataframe = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{character. Properly formatted SPARQL query to be submitted
to an endpoint.}

\item{access_options}{object returned by \code{basic_triplestore_access}
or \code{api_triplestore_access}.}

\item{as_dataframe}{logical. TRUE by default. If TRUE, the results are
returned as a data.frame.}
}
\value{
data.frame or object returned by the triplestore. NA if nothing
 found or query could not be executed.
}
\description{
In case of error, no execution-aborting condition is set! Instead an NA
is returned and a warning may be issued.
}
\details{
This submits to the \code{/repositories/} endpoint, which means that only
certain types (READ) of SPARQL queries are allowed. Namely SELECT,
CONSTRUCT, DESCRIBE, and ASK. For UPDATE-type operations use the
\code{submit_sparql_update} function.

Supported operations:

SELECT
CONSTRUCT
DESCRIBE
ASK
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
query = "SELECT * WHERE {
  ?s ?p ?o .
} LIMIT 100"

submit_sparql(query = query, access_options = graphdb)
}
